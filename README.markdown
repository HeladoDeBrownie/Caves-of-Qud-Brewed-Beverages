Brewed Beverages is a Caves of Qud mod that adds the automatic brewer, a machine that brews delicious (and not-so-delicious) beverages! Unfortunately, the manual has been lost to time.

Find one on every run in Dardi's kitchen!

See [the spoilers](Spoilers.markdown) for more information.

# Installing

See [the Official Caves of Qud Wiki](https://cavesofqud.gamepedia.com/Modding:Installing_a_mod#GitHub) for directions.

# Modding

Integration with other mods is not fully implemented yet. Check back later!

# Contributing

Open an issue or send a pull request on [the project's Github repository](https://github.com/HeladoDeBrownie/Caves-of-Qud-Brewed-Beverages). If you contribute code, make sure your contribution runs in-game.

# Developing

- Install the `dotnet` command.
- Copy or symbolic link `Assembly-CSharp.dll` and `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll` from the *Caves of Qud* installation into this mod's directory. (These are ignored by this project's git settings.)

Now you can `dotnet build` to error check the code and also use Visual Studio Code's code completion.
